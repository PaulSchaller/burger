# burger

*This is a full-stack development project.*

*The user is given a webpage with creative styling that initially displays two lists of burgers and asks the user to input a burger.*

*The first list is a list of burgers that have not been eaten.  The second list of burgers is a list of burgers that have been "devoured".*

*If the user submits a new burger, the burger will be displayed in the list of burgers that have not been eaten.  If the user clicks on the DEVOUR button next to that burger, the burger will move to the list of burgers that have been eaten.  The DEVOUR button will be removed on that burger in the new list.*

*The program runs in node with the initial command line entry "node server.js".*
*The webpage will be listening at "localhost:3000" on the internet.*
*The initial npm installs can be added by the user in the burger node file with the command "npm install".  The dependencies in the json fie will then be added.*

*My heroku link to this project is  https://morning-basin-99252.herokuapp.com/  *


This is how my project will look.

The first screenshot is the initial screen of Eat-Da-Burger:

This screenshot shows the user's entry of a burger in the input field:

The burger that was just entered will be displayed in the list of burgers that have not been eaten with a DEVOUR button next to it:

Once the DEVOUR button is clicked, the burger (the 'WHOPPER') is moved to the list of burgers that have been eaten.

This final screenshot displays the changes in the mysql database during these actions.
